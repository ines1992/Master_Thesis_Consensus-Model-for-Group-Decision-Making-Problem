A Novel Consensus Model for Group Decision-Making Problems Based on Discrete Fuzzy Numbers

Abstract- English Version: 

The linguistic computational model based on discrete fuzzy numbers has gained significant interest among scholars due to its attractive properties. However, the investigations on
group consensus with this linguistic model are not enough and need further exploration. For this reason, in this research study, we propose a novel consensus model based on this framework that overcomes some of the main disadvantages of the previously proposed methods in the literature. Moreover, we provide a new aggregation function on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers. We propose a semi-automatic algorithm that allows the experts to interact and modify their opinions during the consensus process. This novel method achieves a significantly greater convergence rate in Group Decision Making problems than the existing algorithms.

How to run the research project Code:
In order to run the code, you need to install the Python jupyter notebook. It is highly recommended to install Anaconda (However, you can use other tools if you have one to run python notebook files with extension IPYNB)

Then you just download the repository and import into the python jupyter notebook and start running. You just need basic python libraries to work with this project for example:
1. NUMPY
2. PANDAS
3. MATH

NOTE:  In the repository, there are 4 main  code files:
1. Reference Paper Implementation : includes our implemented code of the algorithm of "Measuring and reaching consensus in group decision making with the
linguistic computing model based on discrete fuzzy numbers, Xiao-yu Ma, Meng Zhao, Xiao Zou".
2. Proposed Implementation (Random approach): includes our implemented codes of our own approach with random function(1-3 files have the implmentation with consensus criteria theta = 0.90 and 4-6 files with consensus criteria theta = 0.95)
3. Proposed Implementation (Probability approach): includes our implemented codes of our own approach with probability function(1 file has the implmentation with consensus criteria theta = 0.90 and other file with consensus criteria theta = 0.95)

All done!
